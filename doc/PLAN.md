# Breakout Plan
### Philip Lee

## Interesting Breakout Variants

 * Idea #1: Super Breakout - Power up that can cause the paddle to shoot lasers
that damage everything in its path. Multi ball triggers are also interesting.

 * Idea #2: Obstacle Breakout - A variant that imposes extra walls or obstacles
that are caused when a player hits a "bad" block. 

## Paddle Ideas

 * Idea #1: Warping - moves from one side to the other side when the paddle reaches
the end of the window.
 * Idea #2: Tilting - allows a user to tilt the paddle to redirect the ball.


## Block Ideas

 * Idea #1: Rectangular blocks with different health.

 * Idea #2: Power up blocks.

 * Idea #3: Obstacle blocks - Generates a "bad" block that will create an obstacle
on the screen.

## Power-up Ideas

 * Idea #1: Speed boost: Paddle moves quicker for a certain amount of time.

 * Idea #2: Laser paddle: Shoots a laser that can damage/break everything in its path.

 * Idea #3: Increase length: Paddle increases length for a certain amount of time.


## Cheat Key Ideas

 * Idea #1: Extra lives.

 * Idea #2: Skip a level.

 * Idea #3: Slow-mo. Make the ball move slower indefinitely until a button is pressed.

 * Idea #4: Free power-up. Gives a free power-up to the player.
